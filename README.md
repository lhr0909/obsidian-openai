# OpenAI Plugin for Obsidian

This is a plugin for Obsidian to use OpenAI features.

# Why another one?

I think the current plugins don't fit my needs. I want to be able to use more linking features in Obsidian when I use OpenAI. This way very powerful workflows can be set up (think manual RAG by supplying links).

Also I really enjoy taking voice memos. Being able to transcribe voice memos and YouTube links is going to help me a lot in my daily routines.
